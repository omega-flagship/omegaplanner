"""Test-session hygiene: every tempfile.mkdtemp() made during a test session lands in one session folder, which is
removed when the session ends. Fixtures across the suites call mkdtemp without cleanup; each hive fixture leaves a
data directory (~20 MB), and repeated runs by the platform and owners filled a development machine's disk (2026-10-04: ~10 GB)."""
